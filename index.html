            Two years ago I completed the YLI virtually and learned the importance of being fearless and unreasonalbe. This year as a YLI mentor,
            I put that advice into practice. I strove to be a source of comfort and confidence for my mentees by encouraging them to speak publicly and 
            passionately about their aspirations. Familia 3 became a supportive sisterhood that will survive any amount of distance or time that separates us.
