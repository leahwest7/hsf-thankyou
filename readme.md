Remix this app to make your own card.

This app uses Zdog and was made with some help from Josh Comeau’s website. Check out [Zdog](https://zzz.dog/) to make your own fun 3D models, and Josh Comeau’s post, [Folding the DOM](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/posts/folding-the-dom/), to learn more about the card fold animation.
